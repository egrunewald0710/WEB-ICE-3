            <h2>Eiffel Tower</h2>
            <p>
                Well come on, you know what it is. Very probably the single most famous man-made structure in the entire world, the Eiffel Tower was originally erected as a temporary exhibit for the Exposition Universelle of 1889 (it was due to be taken down in 1909). From its summit, you can enjoy heart-stopping views over all of Paris – and conversely, its iconic form is visible from most vantage points in the city. Aside from the new glass floor that was installed in 2014 – which is a real trip if you’re brave enough to walk across it – there’s also a panoramic champagne bar on the third floor, a brasserie and a Michelin-starred restaurant. At night, the Eiffel’s girders sparkle like fairy lights on a Christmas tree (every hour, on the hour).

            <h2>Musée d'Orsay</h2>
            <p>
                Before it became a world-leading art gallery, the Musée d’Orsay was a major train station (the first electrified train station in the world, actually). But despite being a lovely building it couldn’t accommodate the ever-increasing size of trains, leading the French government to the ingenious idea to fill it with art instead. This is where art fans go for a full-on dose of the biggest and best names in Impressionist and Post-Impressionist art. Lap up all that colour, light and scenic views before also exploring the decorative art collections for Art Nouveau glamour. Lovely.

            <h2>Le Marais</h2>
            <p>
                Once upon a time, the Marais was where you found the movers and shakers of the French aristocracy. Then the French Revolution happened and… yeah. Anyway, since then this Parisian district has found a new lease of life as one of the most trendy, go-to parts of the capital. Head here for LGBTQ+ friendly venues, vintage boutiques and the best collection of art galleries in the city.

            <h2>Arc de Triomphe</h2>
            <p>
                Commissioned by Napoleon but not actually finished until 1836, the Arc de Triomphe is the mother of all war memorials. Give your legs a workout and climb the 284 steps to the top, where the views sweep in geometric splendour between the arc of La Défense and the Louvre. Although you may be more distracted by observing the remarkable Parisian driving techniques in evidence around the unmarked traffic island below: in fact, hire car drivers have to pay extra on the insurance if they’d like it to cover the roundabout. When you get back down to the ground, do spare a thought for the Unknown Soldier whose grave sits solemnly in the centre of the arch.

            <h2>Les Catacombes</h2>
            <p>
                Until you’ve actually been to them, it’s almost impossible to believe that ‘Les Catacombes' actually exist. This 300km (185-mile) network of tunnels runs under much of the city, and very publically contains the bones of some six million people, including many who perished during the Revolutionary Terror. In these claustrophobic corridors, you’ll find the bones of Marat, Robespierre and their comrades, packed in with wall upon wall of fellow citizens. It’s a remarkable and deeply macabre sight. And get your jackets at the ready – the Catacombes are chilly, both literally and spiritually.

            <h2>Canal Saint-Martin</h2>
            <p>
                The Canal Saint-Martin was built between 1805 and 1825 during Napoleon’s day. It was initially intended to bring drinking water and merchandise to the Imperial capital; from the late nineteenth century it housed factories and industrial warehouses.<br>

                It’s all change now: many of those factories have become lofts for Paris’s ever-growing bobo (Bohemian-Bourgeois) population, and dozens of bars, restaurants and shops line its quayside. Its sturdy iron footbridges and picturesque locks are coveted spots for weekend picnics and hikes – especially on Sundays and public holidays when cars are banned and the roads are reserved solely for walkers and cyclists.
